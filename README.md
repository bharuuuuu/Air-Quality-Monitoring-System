# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
INTRODUCTION:
        Air pollution has become a common phenomenon everywhere. Specially in the urban 
areas, air pollution is a real-life problem. Even India has aimed to do so 
by 2025. The use of coal for electricity generation is now going to be a thing of past. The nations are 
now focusing to generate energy from nuclear reactors and the renewable resources like solar 
energy, wind energy and hydroelectric power and also we have implemented the method of Asthma 
problem detection where the people want to travel for different places if they have problem it will 
detect and will notify them whether if they cause that disease.

CONCLUSION: 
        These data are finally stored in a cloud (Blynk app) for future analysis. The main 
objective is to develop an innovative and timesaving system, thereby proposing a solution for 
environmental pollution.
